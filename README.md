# tennisPlanner

This tool provides tennis season planning functionality, with double matches. You can enter a number of participants, tennis courts available, match weeks per season, match days (i.e. Monday and Friday) as well as a start date for the season.

The tool returns a list of matches, which is optimized with regards to an equal amount of matches played per player and preferably playing equally often with and against every other player.
